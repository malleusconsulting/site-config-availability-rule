# site-config-availability-rule
Provides an abstract content app action availability rule that reference site configuration parameters

## Description
This class, although implemented for flexibility, was written to meet a specific use case:
> Having extended the page creation dialog in the Pages app, I only want the new dialog to be shown for specific sites.
> When adding a page to Site A, the extended dialog should be shown.
> However, when adding a page to Site B, the original, non-extended, dialog should still be shown.

## Implementation


## Important
This project is in development and has only been made public to share a beta release with a former client.
